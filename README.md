# CRAVE 🍳  
**From Save to Serve**

Crave is a mobile cooking assistant app that helps users turn saved recipes into real meals by matching fridge ingredients with recipes and generating smart grocery lists.

Built as a hackathon MVP for the **Shipyard Contest**, Crave focuses on reducing the gap between recipe inspiration and actual cooking.

# 🚀 Problem Statement
Many people save recipes from cookbooks, social media, and videos but rarely cook them due to:
- Poor ingredient awareness
- Lack of planning
- Grocery shopping friction
- Decision fatigue

Crave solves this by helping users understand *what they can cook right now* and *what they need to buy*.
